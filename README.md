# Zabbix-Pdf-Screen-Report

***History:***

The need arose to generate Pdfs of the Screens that are generated by Zabbix in my company.
<hr>

***To resolve, I made the following edits:***

monitoring.screen.php Edited to create a botton in Screen.

screens.php Edited to add the JavaScript, that allows you to print the Div that contains the information of the Hosts.

Created report_pdf.php to abstract the JavaScrito adding in screens.php

Copied Main CSS to pdf-theme.css to personalizate details of report

Result:
